# Luxury‑Fashion Category Grid

A **static** (or optionally Express‑served) demo that showcases:

* **Top filters** – material, story, mood (AI‑generated sustainability tags are shown on the chips).  
* **Sort** – editorial picks, most‑traced, newest.  
* **Responsive grid** – 3‑up mobile, 4‑up tablet, 6‑up desktop.  
* **Skeleton placeholders** while data loads.  
* **Infinite scroll** with a graceful “Load more” fallback.  
* **Conversion hack** – a sticky “bundle suggestion” micro‑card appears when the user lingers on a product thumbnail.  
* **Editorial flourish** – hover overlay reveals a curator sentence and a provenance chip.
